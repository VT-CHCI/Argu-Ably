Sketch Feedback							11/03/2014
------------------------
Label on active question not so prominent

something differeent if the students are given roles

how many students have submitted before close question

cool feature: data visualizations
- dynamic
- informs teacher

sidebar
---------
my classes could be drop down and named the actual class
shade it (in progress)
think about personal library of documents 

>> website that makes a 3d view of the DOMs layers

search tags
shows other similar class questions by default and can optionally expand

think of homepage before login
- interesting overview content

tags - personal and others can add

hints - think about more
may be nice to current student to see past arguments to same question

notes
highlights and citations are seperate
more real estate to what the student has done
library can be list instead of thumbnails
search your own notes
exact time of due date
how many words and how many citatations

-------------------
Missing:

* Teacher view - annotating
- red/ green highlighter for for and against
- key document hint? star vs plian text
- using a document for two assignments -different highlights
- practice mode - can reveal large areas the teacher has revealed as important

* Student view - annotating
- draw in margins

-------------------
