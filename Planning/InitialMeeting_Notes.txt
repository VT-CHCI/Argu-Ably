ArguAbly
- Document - based -questions
- Teach students how to read/ interpret/ argue what's going on based on the document
and it's claims.
- 3 Documents on one side, 3 documents on the other, kids choose a side, write an essay
that uses stuff from them to justify their point.
- Teachers work very hard, wants students to do well, not as important educationally
- They have too work hard to find the document, create mock questions, etc.
- So ultimately students don't get as much practice because of time

----
USE CASE:
- Probably going to be used to grade, start out as everyone identified
- Teacher decides on some topic, creates activity in advance
- Finds documents, uploads to system, must tell if for/against, can highlight helpful sections
- Student sees all documents, must choose which ones to use
- Documents have catagories
- Teacher dashboard
- Logging in
- Compose area, submition, notes, reference specific part of document
- Documents have a highlights section
- Write-Up: reference parts of the documents (Almost hyperlink like)
- Interface thoughts: composing argument, can go to document and highlight piece of doc and
it links back to their argument


- Will work with pdf
	- assume pdf has nessessary meta-data
		- meta-data: being able to highlight text within the pdf implies that the text is
		is somewhere in there
		- 
- Screen assumed 1280x1024

PROOF OF CONCEPT:
- Work on interfacing with a pdf


- Future: real-time/ immediate feedback

TESTING:
